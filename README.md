# :warning: IMPORTANT UPDATE :warning:

Our library `@lenml/llama2-tokenizer` has been deprecated. We are excited to introduce our new library `@lenml/tokenizers` as its replacement, offering a broader set of features and an enhanced experience.

## Why switch to `@lenml/tokenizers`?

- **Fully Compatible with `transformers.js` Interfaces**: Seamlessly supports all interfaces defined in `transformers.js`, making migration and integration effortless.
- **Support for a Wide Range of Models**: Regardless of which model you need, our new library supports it, ensuring broader coverage.
- **Rich Feature Implementation**: Includes a complete implementation of chat templates and normalizers to better serve your text processing and tokenization needs.
